# NFHP-Buffer-Code
This ArcPy code was developed at the Aquatic Landscape Ecology Lab at Michigan State University by Arthur Cooper (Principal Investigator: Dana Infante) in support of the National Fish Habitat Partnership (NFHP) 2015 national river assessment (http://www.fishhabitat.org/).  The 90 meter buffers developed for stream/river features of the National Hydrography Dataset Plus v1 (NHDPlus v1: http://www.horizon-systems.com/nhdplus/nhdplusv1_home.php) and used in the assessment can be downloaded at (Website to be updated) and along with a variety of landscape-based attributes (e.g., land use) summarized for these buffers.
